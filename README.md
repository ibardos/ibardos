    Hello! I am Istvan Bardos, a junior Full-Stack Software Developer from Hungary,
    who is living in Vienna, Austria. I am familiar with several programming languages,
    frameworks and software architectural patterns, with a strong focus on Java+Spring
    on the back-end side, and ReactJS on the front-end side.
    I like code when it's DRY and CLEAN, as preciseness and quality is important for me.
    Love to meet new people, and work mutually with others.
    "Growth mindset" is also an important part of my life. I believe, each day should count.
    If you interested, check my demo projects below. Tip: motoShop is my latest.
