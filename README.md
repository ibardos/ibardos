    Hello! I am Istvan Bardos, a Full-Stack Software Developer, from Hungary.
    I am familiar with several programming languages, frameworks and design patterns.
    I like code when it's DRY and CLEAN, as preciseness and quality is important for me.
    Love to meet new people, and work with others.
    "Growth mindset" is also an important part of my life. I believe, each day should count.
