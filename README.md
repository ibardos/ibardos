    Hello! I am Istvan Bardos, a junior Full-Stack Software Developer from Hungary,
    who is living in Vienna, Austria. I am familiar with several programming languages,
    frameworks and software architectural patterns, with a strong focus on Java+Spring
    on the back-end side, and ReactJS on the front-end side.

    I like code when it's DRY and CLEAN, as preciseness and quality is important for me.
    Felt myself comfortable working alone deep inside the "flow", but also love to meet
    with new people, and work in teams towards a mutual goal. "Growth mindset" is also
    an important part of my life. I believe, each day should count, and there's always
    room for improvement.

    If you interested, check my demo projects below!
    Tip: I advice to check motoShop, that's my latest and most comprehensive project.
